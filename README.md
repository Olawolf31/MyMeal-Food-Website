## My Meal Website

This e-commerce React app is built using Context API, React Bootstrap, and React Icons. 

The app has a shopping cart feature that allows users to add items to their cart and view the total cost of their purchases. The checkout process is handled through a modal built using React Bootstrap. The modal displays the items in the cart. The app also uses React Icons to display icons and graphics throughout the user interface.
